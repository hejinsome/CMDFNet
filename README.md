# CMDFNet
We propose a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-Mamba Dual-branch Fusion Network (CMDFNet). It has been deployed at over 20 monitoring sites, where it successfully detected more than 1,600 OF events, further confirming its effectiveness and robustness in complex, real-world environments.
